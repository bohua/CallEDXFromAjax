!! Overview

!!! Motivation:
It is quite easy to reload a current QlikView document if you are using the IE-Plugin or QlikView Desktop. But achieving the same result if you are using the Ajax-/Web-/Mobile-Client is a bit more demaning.
This solution closes the gap using a combined approach of misc. QlikView integration techniques:
* The QMS API (QlikView Management Services API)
* A QlikView Object Extension called "CallEdxFromAjax"

!!! Features:
Using this solution you can offer your QlikView users a solution to reload any QlikView document from within the Ajax-/Mobile-client by just clicking a button.

!!! How does the solution work?
To get the solution up and running you have to:
* Install a small webservice
* Define your reload task within QlikView as EDX task
* Add the CallEDXFromAjax extension to your document
* Define which EDX task should be called if the user clicks the button within the extension ...
*That's it ...*

{anchor:Instructions & How to use}
!! Instructions - How to use:

{anchor:Installation}
!!! Installation

To get the solution running you have to install two different components:
# The web service called "EDXWrapper"
# The QlikView extension called "CallEDXFromAjax"

!!!! Installation of the Web Service

!!!! Installation of the Extension
Installation of the QlikView extension easy and straightforward, there is nothing special to take care of:

# Downlod the extension
# Install the extension on your local computer (doubleclick on the .qar file)
# Drag'n'Drop the extension within QlikView Desktop (using WebView)
# Finally deploy the extension to your server (-> [url:detailed instruction|http://www.qlikblog.at/1597/qliktip-40-installingdeploying-qlikview-extensions/])

{anchor:Step by Step}
!!! Step by Step Configuration

!!!! Web service configuration
There is a section in the web.config of the web service which looks as follows:

{code:xml}
<system.web>      
   <identity impersonate="true" userName="__qvServices" password="Test1234"/>      
   ...
</system.web>
{code:xml}

This section should be changed to work on your system:
* Define a user here which is part of the "QlikView Management API" windows group on the machine where QlikView Mangement Services are running.
* The user connecting to the web service "EDXWrapper" is not authenticated, anonymous authentication should be used (in the simplest scenario) to get the web service up and running

Although I am working at QlikTech this solution and project is not officially supported by QlikTech.
This is just a private project of a real QlikView enthusiast ... ;-)
